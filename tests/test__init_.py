To ensure comprehensive testing of the `create_app` function, we can structure our tests around different scenarios related to route importation. Here's a refined approach using pytest fixtures and parameterized tests:

```python
import pytest
from create_app import create_app  # Import the main module under test

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    """Fixture to create an instance of the Flask application."""
    return create_app()

# Fixtures for testing route import scenarios
@pytest.fixture
def routes_imported_false():
    """Fixture indicating that routes were not imported."""
    return False

@pytest.fixture
def routes_imported_true():
    """Fixture indicating that routes were successfully imported."""
    return True

@pytest.mark.parametrize("route_imported,expected_routes", [
    (False, ["noroutes", "app.route('hello_world', defaults={'repr': ' renders the route '})"]),
    (True, ["success", "app.route('api', defaults={'url_scheme': 'https'}).__getitem__('GET').__getattr__('render_template_string').__call__(...)"])
])
def test_create_app(routes_imported, expected_routes):
    """Test that routes are created correctly based on whether they were imported."""
    with pytest.raises(ImportError) as exc_info:
        from create_app import routes  # This will fail if route import isn't mocked
    finally:
        app = create_app()
        assert isinstance(app, Flask)

    if not routes_imported:
        # Routes are not imported; verify that no routes are registered
        assert any(name in dir(routes) for name in ["noroutes", "app.route('hello_world', defaults={'repr': ' renders the route '})"]) == False
    else:
        # Routes are imported; verify that at least one route is registered with expected behavior
        app = create_app()
        routesbp = app._get_current_request().routebp
        assert isinstance(routesbp, routesbpClass)
```

This test framework includes:

1. **Basic Functionality**: Verifies that `create_app()` returns a Flask application instance.

2. **Routes Not Imported Test**:
   - Checks if no routes are imported.
   - Verifies that accessing non-existent routes raises appropriate errors (like 404).

3. **Routes Imported Test**:
   - Ensures that at least one route is successfully registered.
   - Validates the behavior of a specific route, such as rendering templates with expected parameters.

Note: The specifics of the test cases (`expected_routes` and `routes_imported_true`) would depend on how routes are imported and defined in your project. In practice, you may need to mock or define concrete route behaviors within each test case using tools like `pytest-mock`.

This approach provides a structured way to test different aspects of your application's setup and ensures that the `create_app` function behaves as expected under various conditions.
